          Creative Coding Santé a.k.a CCSanté  is a series of one day events, hackathons and meetups focussing on creative coding.
          Our first official event will be on May 25th in Bangalore. A day full of hands on workshops and informal networking to introduce you to creative coding and some amazing possibilities with it. 
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          The idea that software is for engineers, or that creativity is for aritsts is antiquated. We are in an age where we need Science and Engineering to combine with Creativity and Art. Creative coding is one step in that direction where we introduce programming to the artists, and art to the programmers.
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          A focus of this collective is to make learning how to program and make creative work with code accessible to diverse communities, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.

              This workshop will walk through the basic concepts of programming while we make art with code. We will learn about functions, loops and recap trignometry all while generating different pieces of algorithmic art.
              <br>
              No knowledge of p5.js or coding is required for this session. 
              <br>
              For those of you who are already familiar with p5.js, we will have a hackathon on generative paintings running parallely!

              In this workshop, we'll learn how to create art with data. We'll explore what our phones already know about us, find insights from this data, and try a unique way to visualize this on paper & using code.
